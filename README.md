### Background On Our Project
Skin cancer is the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions.

### Dataset
Link: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FDBW86T

More than 50% of lesions are confirmed through histopathology (histo), the ground truth for the rest of the cases is either follow-up examination (follow_up), expert consensus (consensus), or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy (confocal). The dataset includes lesions with multiple images, which can be tracked by the lesion_id-column within the HAM10000_metadata file.

Diseases Detectable:
1. Normal Human Skin
2. Melanoma
3. Benign keratosis-like lesions
4. Basal cell carcinoma
5. Actinic keratoses
6. Vascular lesions
7. Dermatofibroma
